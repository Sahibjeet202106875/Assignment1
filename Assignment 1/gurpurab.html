            <b><p>Gurpurab, also known as Guru Nanak Jayanti, is one of the most important festivals in Sikhism, celebrating the birth of the first Sikh Guru, Guru Nanak Dev Ji.

            <img src="images/gurpurab2.jpg" alt="Guru Nanak Dev Ji">
            <b><p>The festival is marked by processions, singing of hymns, reading of the Guru Granth Sahib, and the distribution of Langar, a community meal offered to all attendees without distinction of religion, caste, gender, economic status, or ethnicity. The celebrations begin two days before the actual date with the Akhand Path, a continuous reading of the Guru Granth Sahib.</p>
            
            <p>On the day of Gurpurab, devotees gather in Gurdwaras to offer prayers. The air resonates with the recitation of various hymns and poems in praise of Guru Nanak. The essence of Gurpurab lies in remembering Guru Nanak's teachings, which include the love of God, the importance of honesty, and the equality of all humans.</p>
            
            <p>The festival not only commemorates the birth of Guru Nanak but also serves as a reminder of his teachings and the values he stood for. It is a day of reflection, prayer, and reaffirmation of the commitment to follow the path laid down by him.</p></b>
