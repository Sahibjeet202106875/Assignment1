            <b><p>Krishna Janmashtami, also known simply as Janmashtami, is a revered annual Hindu festival that celebrates the birth of Krishna, the eighth avatar of Vishnu. It is observed on the eighth day (Ashtami) of the dark fortnight in the month of Bhadrapada, which overlaps with August or September of the Gregorian calendar.</p></b>
            
            <img src="images/krishnajanmashtmi2.jpg" alt="Krishna Idol">
            <b><p>The festival is marked by various traditions such as singing bhajans dedicated to Krishna, fasting, a night vigil (Jagaran), and a festival (Mahotsav) on the following day. Devotees also enact dance-dramas based on the life of Krishna, and in places like Mathura and Vrindavan, the celebrations are particularly grand.</p>
            
            <p>One of the most delightful rituals of Janmashtami is the Dahi Handi, where pots of yogurt are hung high above the ground, and teams of young men form human pyramids to reach and break them, emulating Krishna's playful and mischievous side.</p>
            
            <p>The festival is not only a religious event but also a time for community celebration. It brings together people from all walks of life, symbolizing unity and faith. The message of Krishna Janmashtami resonates with love, joy, and the victory of good over evil.</p></b>
