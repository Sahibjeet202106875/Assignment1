            <b><p>Diwali, also known as Deepavali, is the Hindu festival of lights celebrated with great enthusiasm across India and by Indian communities worldwide. This auspicious festival symbolizes the spiritual "victory of light over darkness, good over evil, and knowledge over ignorance." Diwali is observed during the Hindu lunisolar months of Ashvin and Kartika, which typically fall between mid-October and mid-November.</p>
            </b>
            <img src="images/diwali2.jpg" alt="Diwali Fireworks">
            <b><p>The festival's preparations and rituals typically extend over a five-day period, but the main festival night coincides with the new moon night of Kartika. Homes and public spaces are decorated with small oil lamps called 'diyas,' which serve as a representation of the inner light that protects from spiritual darkness.</p>
            
            <p>Diwali celebrations include millions of lights shining on housetops, outside doors and windows, and around temples and other buildings. The festivities also involve fireworks, feasting, sharing of sweets and gifts, and the recitation of prayers. Diwali is not only a time for celebration but also a time for reflection, a time to remember that light triumphs over darkness and knowledge over ignorance.</p>
            
            <p>One of the most significant rituals during Diwali is the worship of Lakshmi, the goddess of wealth and prosperity, and Ganesha, the remover of obstacles. The festival also marks a major shopping period, with people buying new clothes, home decor, and gifts for family and friends.</p>
            
            <p>Diwali's message of peace and joy is universal, making it a celebration for all, irrespective of faith or background. It's a time when people come together, setting aside their differences to share in the spirit of the festival.</p></b>
